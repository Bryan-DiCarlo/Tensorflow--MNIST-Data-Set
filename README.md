# Tensorflow--MNIST-Data-Set
The MNIST Data Set is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.  Here 
we use Tensorflow ML/Neural network algorithm to predict the actual digits from the MNIST data set. Our model was able to correctly 
classify the actual digits, from the images of handwritten numbers, at a rate of roughly 92%
